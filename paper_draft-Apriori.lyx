\begin_layout Abstract ICS
In the current literature, several algorithms are proposed for the implementatio
n of association rule mining in the field of data science such as Apriori,
 FP-growth, Eclat etc.
 These algorithms are analyzed and compared based on their use cases and
 their efficiency in terms of execution time.
 Apriori algorithm stands out in terms of its straightforward implementation
 but also it has major drawbacks when its being applied to the large datasets.
 In this paper, previously presented research on improving Apriori will
 be studied in detail and an optimized version of the existing work in the
 literature will be proposed.
 The newly proposed algorithm will be implemented and executed on a large
 real-world dataset for comparison in terms of efficiency.

Nowadays, the data production rate is faster than it has ever been.
 The advancements in computer hardware and database systems enabled us to
 store huge amounts of data at cheaper costs.
 Alongside that, with the evolution of information technologies there is
 a big growth of data in science, engineering, medicine, business and in
 almost every field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, analyzing this data and extracting meaningful information becomes
 a challenging task for humans since exponentially growing data is not possible
 to be analyzed manually.
 It simply exceedes our ability for comprehension.
 As a result, dealing with this task in an automated manner is becoming
 an important topic and gets more attention in the research field of data
 mining

Data mining is the extraction of unrevealed patterns and interesting knowledge.
 It can play an important role in many organizations giving insight of patterns
 in their data to make decisions, with the purpose of increasing revenue,
 cutting costs etc.
 It is also often referred as KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) in
 the literature.
 There are many different techniques used in data mining such as anomaly
 detection, clustering, classification, regression, association rule mining,
 summarization etc.

Techniques used in data mining can be classified into two categories as
 descriptive and predictive.
 In descriptive data mining, what happened in the past is investigated by
 analyzing past data.
 Anomaly detection, clustering and association rule mining are some of the
 descriptive data mining techniques.
 Meanwhile, predictive data mining is used to identify what can happen in
 the future based on the present data.
 Classification, regression are some of the example techniques that belongs
 to predictive data mining

 The aim of this paper is to propose an improved version of Apriori algorithm
 - one of the well-known algorithms used in association rule mining, to
 reduce its execution time when being applied to a large dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to have a clear understanding of association rule mining at algorithms
 used for this purpose, one should study some preliminary concepts presented
 at Section 1.1.

\begin_layout Standard
Let us define the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
𝐷 = {𝑇
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

,\SpecialChar ldots
, 𝑇
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

}, a database contains a set of transactions where each transaction denoted
 as 𝑇.
 Each transaction is also associated with a unique identifier called its
 𝑇𝐼𝐷.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
𝐼 = {𝑖
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

}, a set of items where each item is denoted as 𝑖.
 Each transaction 𝑇 is a nonempty itemset such that 𝑇 ⊆ 𝐼.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then we can say if 𝑋 ⊆ 𝑇 is true; transaction 𝑇 contains X, a subset of
 𝐼.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Association rules are if/then statements that uncover relationships of items
 in a database 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 We can define an association rule as 𝑋 ⇒𝑌, meaning that whenever 𝑋 occurs,
 there is a strong correlation of 𝑌 occuring.
 Here 𝑋 and 𝑌 denotes the set of items that are included in transaction
 𝑇.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
𝑋 ⇒𝑌, where 𝑋 ⊂ 𝐼, 𝑌 ⊂ 𝐼 and 𝑋 ∩ 𝑌 = {}, an empty set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main interestingness measures used in association rule mining;
 support and confidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

(𝑋 ⇒𝑌) =

(𝑋 ∪ 𝑌) = 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{Count\:of\:transactions\:containing\:items\:(𝑋∪𝑌)}{Total\:number\:of\:transactions\:in\:𝑇}$
\end_inset

, , is the percentage of transactions in 𝐷 that contains the union of sets
 𝑋 and 𝑌.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on

(𝑋 ⇒𝑌) =

(𝑋 | 𝑌) =

\end_inset

, is the percentage of transactions in 𝐷 containing 𝑋 that also contains
 𝑌.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, following two definitions are useful to comprehend the steps
 of the algorithms that will be explained later on.

Association rule mining can be overviewed as a two-step approach as first,
 discovering all frequent itemsets that have support value above the minimum
 support treshold and second, use these frequent itemsets to generate associatio
n rules that satisfy a minumum confidence treshold

 Throughout the years, many different algoritms are presented in the literature
 to handle the task of association rule mining.
 However, improvements are still needed in performance perspective because
 of long execution time and heavy overload on memory of these algorithms.
 Because the second step is much less costly than the first one, performance
 of the algorithm is mainly dependent on the first step

\begin_layout Standard
Many researchers have put effort into developing efficient algorithms for
 association rule mining since the beginning of 1990's.
 The key algorithms in the literature are examined in the following section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
AIS and SETM Algorithms

\begin_layout Standard
AIS 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Agrawal1993Miningassociationrules"

\end_inset

 is the first algorithm presented in the literature followed by SETM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HoutsmaSetorientedmining"

\end_inset

, which was motivated by the aim of using SQL.
 Candidate generation in both of these algorithms are on-the-fly during
 passing over the database as the data is being read.
 Then candidate itemsets are generated by extending frequent itemsets with
 all other items in the transaction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of this specific attribute, they generate so many non-essential
 candidate itemsets that eventually turned out to to not satisfying the
 minimum support level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 AIS and SETM algorithms are not very popular nowadays due to their limitations
 but they paved a foundation for the next algorithms to be developed in
 the literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Apriori Algorithm
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Apriori Algorithm"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following that, in 1994 Agrawal and Srikant proposed a more efficient algorithm
 alternative to AIS and STEM, called Apriori 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Agrawal1994FastAlgorithmsMining"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Main difference of Apriori compared to AIS and SETM was that in Apriori,
 candidate itemsets are generated in a pass over the itemsets found frequent
 in previous passing, without passing over all the transactions in the database.
 This is because of the assumption that any subset of a frequent itemset
 must be frequent.
 Therefore, any subset of a non-frequent itemset is also not frequent.
 Using this property, Apriori prunes the items which is not a subset of
 a frequent itemset, resulting in a smaller number of candidate itemsets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apriori employs an iterative approach known as a level-wise search, where
 (𝑘-1)-itemsets are used to explore 𝑘-itemsets.
 First passing over the database counts the frequency of each item and determine
s frequent 1-itemsets.
 The following passes, denoted as pass 𝑘, generates candidate itemsets 𝐶
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 by finding the frequent itemsets 𝐿
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

during the (𝑘-1)th passing.
 Then database is scanned again to count frequency of each candidate in
 𝐶

It is clear that Apriori was a step forward compared to AIS and SETM since
 it improved the candidate generation.
 However, this is still a very costly step and time complexity of Apriori
 is O(2

 It was a divide-and-conquer method that introduced a novel approach by
 compressing the database into a frequent pattern tree structure for mining
 the frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth.
 By compressing the database into a condensed data structure, frequent scanning
 of the database is improved.
 Moreover, thanks to its pattern fragment method, huge generation of candidate
 itemsets is avoided compared to Apriori.
 FP-growth was able to run about an order of magnitude faster than Apriori.
 However, its recursion nature imposed difficulties in terms of space requiremen
ts when database is very large and sparse

Another key algorithm presented in literature was Eclat by Zaki 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zaki2000Scalablealgorithmsassociation"

\end_inset

.
 It uses a vertical data format in which data is presented as {
\emph on
item
\emph default
 : 
\emph on
TID_se
\emph default
t}, 
\emph on
item 
\emph default
being the item name and
\emph on
 TID_set 
\emph default
as transaction identifier.
 Comparing to Apriori and FP-growth, where they use horizontal data format
 which is in the form {
\emph on
TID : itemset
\emph default
}.
 Thanks to this different representation of data, Eclat was able to calculate
 frequency of each itemset by just taking the number of elements in the
 list, so database does not need to be scanned multiple times.
 It scans the database once to transform the data from horizontal format
 to vertical format.
 Then two itemsets can be joined by intersecting their lists.
 Again this algorithm was not efficient when applied on large databases
 because of intersecting frequent lists of transactions

Several algorithms are developed to improve original Apriori algorithm.
 It can be observed that the majority of them tries to address candidate

 As mentioned previously, this is the most costly step in the original Apriori

 Its basis is a very simple approach where all the itemsets in 𝐿
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 Resulting in a smaller sized 𝐶

 This is achieved by splitting the items in a frequent itemset 𝐿

 In the original Apriori, this is not present and all transactions are scanned

 This improvement has reduced the execution time during candidate generation
 considerably.

 First the database is transformed into vertical data format.

As it can be seen from the previous section, improved Apriori algorithms
 use different approaches to address large candidate generation problem.
 They optimize Apriori up to some extent.
 However, all of the algorithms examined only relies on one measure, support
 count.
 And this is one of the gaps in the literature.
 There are several interestingness measures in statistics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Le2015supportconfidenceExploring"

\end_inset

 that can be utilized in Apriori as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a recent study published in 2023 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HeidariIman2023automatedmethodmining"

\end_inset

, multiple interestingness measures are used for mining high quality assertion
 sets.
 The interestingness measures used are support, CC and IS that are presented
 in a study 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tan2000InterestingnessMeasuresAssociation"

\end_inset

 that shows favorable results in association patterns.
 Then another novel approach called dominance algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bouker2014MiningUndominatedAssociation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, is applied to evaluate high quality assertion sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dominance algorithm is successfully used in mining assertions and it
 can be used in association rules as well.
 In fact there is a study that implements dominance in association rules,
 based on three different interestingness measures; frequency, confidence
 and pearl 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bouker2012RankingSelectingAssociation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this proposal implemented dominance on the rules itself.
 Association rule mining is a two step process as mentioned earlier, and
 candidate generation is the costly step.
 Dominance can also be applied in Apriori algorithm during candidate generation
 step to prune uninteresting candidate sets, thus improving efficiency overall.

\begin_layout Standard
In the further progress of this thesis, this approach is going to be implemented
 and compared with Apriori using large databases.
